# VoF_Microchannel
 This is a two-phase flow model in a microchannel.

The VOF model is chosen to simulate the flow of gas-liquid two-phase in a channel(d=3.2mm).The validity of the simulation parameters and model selection is verified under the conditions of previous experiments to simulate a similar gas-liquid flow pattern.The slug flow can be formed when the velocity ratio of gas and liquid is 1:1 or so,and the length of the gas and liquid slug increases with the increase of superficial velocity.

## Parameter Settings & Physical properties

2D mesh was generated by ANSYS ICEM `fluent.msh`

model: Laminar

initial phase: all water

initial velocity field: uniform (0 0 0)

initial pressure field: 0

water inlet: uniform 1, -0.1m/s

air inlet: uniform 0, 0.1m/s

outlet: `pressureInletOutletVelocity`

wall surface: non-sliding

g = 9.81 (downward)

water: density = 998.2 viscosity = 1E-06

air: density = 1.225  viscosity = 1.48e-05

surface tension = 0.072
